# My Portfolio - built with bootstrap.

## Desription

This is my second portfolio page, showcasing my work i have created so far, either as part of my course or in my own time. We looked at using bootstrap componants and were tasked with creating our portfolio using specified bootstrap componants and tools. 

I wanted to build a page that was simple in colour, dark with some grey and blacks, with one accent colour. I used the accent colour on buttons to add a quick flash of colour at certain times.
